# Troubleshooting
## Error when starting Verinice in macOS
Starting Verinice on macOS may fail with one of the following errors:

### The Verinice executable launcher was unable to locate its companion shared library.
In this case, please remove the Extended File Attributes of the directory
`verinice. app` with the following command (in the terminal):

-	Open the "Terminal.app"
-	Enter the following command:

		xattr -cr /path/to/verinice/verinice.app

-	close the Terminal application (clicking the "x")
-	double-clicking the file "verinice.app" from the Finder should start the
	application now

### The application "Verinice" can't be opened
In this case the executable file of Verinice needs the "x" flag to be set.
To do this, follow this steps:

-	open the "Terminal.app"
-	navigate into the installation directory of the Verinice (directory that
	contains the file "verinice.app") by using the command "cd"
-	enter the following command to switch to the inside of the verinice.app-package:

		cd verinice.app/Contents/MacOS

-	set the executable flag (x) for the binary file by entering:

		chmod +x verinice

-	close the Terminal application (clicking the "x")
-	double-clicking the file "verinice.app" from the Finder should start the
	application now
