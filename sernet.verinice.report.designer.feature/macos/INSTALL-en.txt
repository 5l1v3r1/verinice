# Troubleshooting
## Error when starting vDesigner in macOS
Starting the vDesigner on may fail with one of the following errors:

### The vDesigner executable launcher was unable to locate its companion shared library.
In this case, please remove the Extended File Attributes of the directory
`vdesigner. app` with the following command (in the terminal):

-	Open the "Terminal.app"
-	Enter the following command:

		xattr -cr /path/to/vdesigner/vdesigner.app

-	close the Terminal application (clicking the "x")
-	double-clicking the file "vdesigner.app" from the Finder should start the
	application now

### The application "vDesigner" can't be opened
In this case the executable file of the vDesigner needs the "x" flag to be set.
To do this, follow this steps:

-	open the "Terminal.app"
-	navigate into the installation directory of the vDesigner (directory that
	contains the file "vdesigner.app") by using the command "cd"
-	enter the following command to switch to the inside of the vdesigner.app-package:

		cd vdesigner.app/Contents/MacOS

-	set the executable flag (x) for the binary file by entering:

		chmod +x vdesigner

-	close the Terminal application (clicking the "x")
-	double-clicking the file "vdesigner.app" from the Finder should start the
	application now
